# To-Do-List
It is a simple and intuitive Todo List application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project allows users to add tasks with due dates, dynamically render a list of tasks, and delete tasks as needed. It is a great starting point for understanding DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
